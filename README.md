# COCO_TOOLS
Tools for the COCO-formatted JSON annotation files. 

## Scale a whole dataset annotated with a COCO-File. 
Currently only supports BBox. Just give input cocofile and a path to image directory. Images would be scaled to the wished size KxK, saved in output directory. A new COCO-file would be generated with the updated information.
